# theme
This is a Wordpress starter theme. 

I'added Grunt for compiling SASS and JS.

After clonning the project you need to npm install and bower install into the blue-spark folder, then run "start grunt watch" command to open a new window.

The css file will be found in the assets folder of the theme and the wp function is allready made.
